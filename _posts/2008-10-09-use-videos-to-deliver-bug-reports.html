<p><a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2008/10/github-e-mail-cant-be-blank.html">Giles Bowkett found a bug in GitHub, and documented it with a video.</a> This got me thinking about embedding videos in JIRA (or your favorite issue tracker) on bug reports. I don't know if there's a way to do this at the moment, and it'd certainly require a bit of infrastructure to support. But think of the possibilities. Instead of writing out what steps are necessary to recreate a bug, testers can upload a video capture... </p>
<p>Then again, videos still aren't greppable. </p>
