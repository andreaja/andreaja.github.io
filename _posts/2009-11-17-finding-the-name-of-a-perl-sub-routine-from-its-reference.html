<p>While mucking around with Perl's Test::Simple I needed to find out the name of a sub routine from a reference. While there are several answers, finding any useful ones by the usual means was difficult. The one I landed on was using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Sub-Identify/">Sub::Identify</a>, which provides the routine sub_name($) that solves the problem nicely. </p>
<p>Here's some example code:<br />
{% highlight text %}
perl -MSub::Identify -e 'sub bar{return "baz"};$foo=\&amp;bar;print Sub::Identify::sub_name($foo). "\n"'
{% endhighlight %}
<p>This correctly prints "bar". </p>
