<p>BDD is short for <a title="Behavior-driven development" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">Behavior-driven development</a>. The Wikipedia article on BDD is really long, but as far as I can tell BDD is better summed up as: "When you're writing code, examples are really helpful so you should get as many as you can stomach. If anything is unclear, ask for some more examples."</p>
<p>I don't know if it's strictly in following with BDD, but a lot of the time I ask for examples that aren't like previous examples. That can be pretty enlightening.</p>
