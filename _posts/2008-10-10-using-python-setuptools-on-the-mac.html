<p>Python's standard tool for package management is setuptools. The version of setuptools bundled with Mac OS X Leopard is 0.6c7. Unfortunately, setuptools is not self-upgrading, in that it won't replace the easy_install script in /usr/bin, and there's no official .dmg/.pkg to upgrade it. This is important because the easy_install script that's used to install new packages has a hardcoded version of setuptools in it, that it reads from the Python libraries bundled with Leopard.</p>
<p>The hardcoded version string in easy_install became a problem when I tried to install a package that relied on a newer version of setuptools:<br />

The required version of setuptools (&gt;=0.6c8) is not available, and
can't be installed while this script is running. Please install
  a more recent version first, using 'easy_install -U setuptools'.

<p>Installing a newer version of setuptools didn't actually help, since easy_install doesn't get touched by this. There are two (sensible solutions) to this. Either edit /usr/bin/easy_install to reflect the newer version of the setuptools package, or use the easy_install module from python rather than the executable. The latter is preferable since it doesn't involve manually changing stuff in /usr/bin, which is just plain wrong.</p>
<p>So this is how to correctly install packages that rely on a version of setuptools newer than .6c7 on a Mac:<br />

<p>This works because python searches sys.path, and the /Library/Python site packages are placed before the bundled packages.</p>
<p>The state of easy_install isn't that great. There are basically three alternatives to installing python packages. One is to use the OS package manager, which works on Linux distros like Debian/Ubuntu, where just about everything is ported to a .deb and put in the apt repositories. Unfortunately, macports <a href="http://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&substr=python">doen't have many python packages</a>. The other is to use easy_install, warts and all. The third is to download source distros and use distutils to install them (using python setup.py install), which has a very nice retro feel to it. Fortunately, <a href="http://www.openplans.org/projects/topp-engineering/blog/2008/09/24/pyinstall-a-new-hope/">help does seem to be on the way</a>.</p>
