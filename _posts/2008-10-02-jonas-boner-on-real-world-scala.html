<p>Jonas Bonér has <a href="http://jonasboner.com/2008/10/01/real-world-scala-introduction/">posted an introduction to a series about how his company has used Scala for their product</a>. I'm looking forward to reading the series. Worth noting is that he said his team picked up Scala quite quickly. </p>
<p>I'm very much looking forward to reading about the best practices and design choices they made. I'd also like to hear about how they dealt with their Java stack. Specifically, whether they put anything between the Java frameworks or called them directly from their Scala application.</p>
