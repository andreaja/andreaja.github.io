<p>Apparently 	<a href="http://www.lispcast.com/drupal/node/55">Java is a library oriented programming language</a> because code is packaged as a... library. This makes me wonder what distinguishes it from <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/">C</a>. I used to think it was this whole classes and objects thing, but I guess I was wrong. Maybe Java should be called Garbage Collection oriented programming. </p>
