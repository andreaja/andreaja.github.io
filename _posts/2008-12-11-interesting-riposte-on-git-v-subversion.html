<p><a href="http://blog.assembla.com/assemblablog/tabid/12618/bid/7437/Why-Subversion-does-not-suck.aspx">Andy Singleton posted a reply</a> to (among others) my rant on <a href="http://andreasjacobsen.com/2008/10/26/subversion-sucks-get-over-it/">Subversion sucking</a>. The thought experiment is pretty interesting. I'm not convinced though.</p>
<p>In general, I see more technological options opening up on many fronts. Version control is just one of these. While I hope people I work with move away from Subversion (so I don't need to deal with, a highly personal preference), I don't think it's going to die any time soon. I do think it's going to be more distributed in the future. Local history in Subversion 1.8 anyone? </p>
